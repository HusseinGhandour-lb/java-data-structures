# Java Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **data structures in Java**.  
Each data structure is written from scratch to better understand how they work internally.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project includes the following data structures:

- **Array List**
- **Singly Linked List**
- **Doubly Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Binary Search Tree**

## âš¡ Features
- Implemented in **pure Java** (no external libraries)
- Clean and well-documented code
- Example usage provided for each data structure in the "Main.java" file
- Focus on understanding **time complexity** and **core operations**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) or just a terminal
