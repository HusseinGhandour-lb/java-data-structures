- **Array List**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Binary Tree**
- **Binary Search Tree**

## âš¡ Features
- Implemented in **pure Java** (no external libraries)
- Clean and well-documented code
- Example usage provided for each data structure in the "Main.java" file
- Focus on understanding **time complexity** and **core operations**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans) or just a terminal
